**LinkedGeoData** is an effort to add a spatial dimension to the Web of Data / Semantic Web. LinkedGeoData uses the information collected by the OpenStreetMap project and makes it available as an RDF knowledge base according to the Linked Data principles. It interlinks this data with other knowledge bases in the Linking Open Data initiative.

## The LinkedGeoData Knowledge Base
In order to employ the Web as a medium for data and information integration, comprehensive datasets and vocabularies are required as they enable the disambiguation and alignment of other data and information. Many real-life information integration and aggregation tasks are impossible without comprehensive background knowledge related to spatial features of the ways, structures and landscapes surrounding us.

LinkedGeoData uses the comprehensive OpenStreetMap spatial data collection to create a large spatial knowledge base. It consists of more than 3 billion nodes and 300 million ways and the resulting RDF data comprises approximately 20 billion triples. The data is available according to the Linked Data principles and interlinked with DBpedia and Geo Names.


This site provides information about the LinkedGeoData community project:

* **[Datasets](docs/downloads)** gives an overview about the LinkedGeoData knowledge base and allows to download the whole dataset.
* **Online** Access describes how the data set can be accessed via Linked Data.
* **Use Cases** lists different LinkedGeoData use cases.
* **Publications** gives an overview about LinkedGeoData related publications.
* **Community** explains how the LinkedGeoData community collaborates and how people can contribute to the effort.
